# 📘 Large-Scale Node Classification
Scalable node classification on millions of nodes and edges by leveraging PyTorch Geometric and Lightning. Train on a single GPU or multiple GPUs with benchmarks from the [OGB project](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/) using classical Graph Neural Networks like GraphSAGE and GAT.

## 🚀 Get Started
1. Refer to this [installation guide](https://github.com/vuptran/node-classification/tree/main/docs/installation).
2. Download and convert the [supported datasets](https://github.com/vuptran/node-classification/tree/main/data).
3. Run the example [training scripts](https://github.com/vuptran/node-classification/tree/main/scripts).
